	 *  locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
	 *  The elements are linked using references(pointers and addresses).
	 *  Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions,
	 *  they are preferred over the arrays.
	 *  It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly
	 *  instead we need to start from the head and follow through the link to reach
	 *  to a node we wish to access. In java.util package. it is implemented as a doubly LinkedList.
